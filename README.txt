Windows Builds for class_conductor.pyx
--------------------------------------
mler, 27.03.2019

These are builds of the Cython-optimized version of class_conductor for the GoalRef simulation model.
Just copy the right one for your Python version into the same folder class_conductor.py is in.
If you are unsure, just copy all of them and try if it helps...

The file names contain the Python version, for which they are built (e.g. cp37-win_amd64 is for 64-bit Python 3.7 on Windows).

The code for these builds lives in the Database branch on the goalref_simulation Repo:
